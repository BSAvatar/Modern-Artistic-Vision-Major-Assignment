            <h3> A brief history of the Artist </h3>  <!-- History of the movement-->
            
            <br>
            The Modern art period began in the 1860's and lasted all the way umtil 1975. 
            It enotes the styles and philosophies of the art produced during that era.
            he term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation. 
            Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials 
            and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, 
            toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called 
            contemporary art or postmodern art.

            <h4> Modern Legacy </h4>   <!--the legacy of modern art and what it entails-->
                The Truth about Modern Art is that it a blanket term for many movement that came from around the time period. 
                Essentially, Modernism was a period in which many movements existed. What made these movements 
                similar was the unifying characteristic that rejected all traditional forms of art, 
                which made them each modern within their own sense.
